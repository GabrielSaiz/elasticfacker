```
Disclaimer: This is a work in progress...

Please note that this is a very simplified approach to mocking and may not be suitable for all use cases. 
In particular, this approach only allows you to define one mock response for each method, 
regardless of the arguments passed to it. If you need more complex behaviour, 
such as returning different responses depending on the arguments or changing responses over time, 
you would need a more sophisticated solution.
